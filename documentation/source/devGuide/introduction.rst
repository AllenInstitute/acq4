Introduction
============

How Difficult Will It Be?
-------------------------

You decide. Many layers of abstraction, but you aren't required to use any of them. Many services provided by the program can simply be embedded in other existing applications.



Where Should I Start?
---------------------

First: Ask! No reason to start off in the wrong direction..

If you want to add support for a device, read the devices section. If you want to add new experimental functionality, consider writing a module (module section) or adding new functionality to protocolrunner (link). If you want to add new analysis, read the analysis section.



Code Control

DVCS, BZR, Launchpad
