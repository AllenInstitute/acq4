Installation
============

ACQ4 depends on several free software packages to work properly. These packages must be installed (in order) before running ACQ4:
    
    #. Python 2.6
    #. Numpy
    #. Scipy
    #. PyQt 4.x  (PySide support in development)

These are the minimal requirements to run ACQ4 (eg, for data analysis). It is probably easiest to ask Luke to send you the needed files.

For data acquisition, there are extra requirements:
    
    #. pyparsing
    #. pyserial (only if using serial devices--Sutter MP285, serial mice, etc)
    
You also need to make sure that the drivers for your devices are installed and working properly. 

Once all prerequisites are installed, download ACQ4 (stable or development branch)
