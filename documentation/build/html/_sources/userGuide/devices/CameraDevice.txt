Camera Devices
==============

Hardware Configuration
----------------------

Physical layout, triggering, exposure signals...

Note: If the exposure signal from the camera is connected to both DI and PFI ports, the DI recording may fail if the PFI is not being used.
This is because the PFI ports have very low impedance when unused.


Configuration Options
---------------------


Manager Interface

Protocol Runner Interface
