The examples here are configuration files from a few of the systems we use with ACQ4. 
They have a variety of different hardware configurations:

noyo:
   Used primarily for UV uncaging calcium imaging, and 2p imaging/photostimulation experiments
   NI PCI-6259
   MultiClamp 700A
   Photometrics Quantix 57 (camera)
   Cambridge Tech. galvometric scan mirrors
   DPSS UV laser with uniblitz shutter
   Serial device reading stage position and objective lens
   Digitally controlled LEDs
     
tulare:
   Used primarily for ChR2 photostimulation experiments
   NI PCI-6251
   NI PCI-MIO 16E
   AxoPatch 200
   AxoProbe 1A
   QImaging Retiga 2000 (camera)
   Thorlabs galvo scan mirrors
   Uniblitz shutter (for blue laser)
   (no stage position readout)

cambria:
   Used primarily for calcium imaging experiments
   NI PCI-6251
   Photometrics QuantEM 512
   MultiClamp 700B

underwood:
   A laptop running Linux, used primarily for data analysis.
   This configuration also has a few 'mock' devices which allow the acquisition 
   system to be tested in the absence of real hardware.
