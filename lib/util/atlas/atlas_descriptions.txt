Atlases:

Allen Reference Atlas (www.brain-map.org)
  - highest resolution--25um atlas, 520x348x456
  - atlas labels 210 regions, including CN
  - data inexplicably rotates around R-C axis, causing deformation in CN

LONI (www.loni.ucla.edu)
  - MRI atlas, 346x346x346
  - average of several scans, but no registration is used so we get double-vision.
  - atlas labels 53 regions

MICe (http://www.mouseimaging.ca/)
  - MRI atlas, 141x274x210 (lowest resolution)
  - average of 40 animals; very smooth, clear data
  - atlas labels 43 regions
  - supposedly has blockface atlas as well, but I can't find that data..
  
  
Harvard High res mouse brain atlas (http://www.hms.harvard.edu/research/brain/index.html)
  - Stack of nissl slices, probably highest resolution
  - slices don't match perfectly; R-C axis is a bit rough.
  - can't download data?

GENSAT

brainmaps.org
  - very high-res nissl images (you can identify cell types)
  - not suitable as 3D atlas

Mouse Brain Library (mbl.org)
  - nissl sections with very coarse spacing
  
Caltech (http://mouseatlas.caltech.edu/)
  - development atlas; no adult data
  
neuroterrain.org
  - 3D section-based atlas
  - Website is down

edinburgh mouse atlas project (http://genex.hgu.mrc.ac.uk/)
  - only embryonic; no adult.
