Installation
============

Pyqtgraph currently does not have (or really require) any installation scripts. The only requirement is that the pyqtgraph folder to be placed someplace importable. Most people will prefer to simply place pyqtgraph within a larger project folder. If you want to make pyqtgraph available system-wide, copy pyqtgraph to one of the directories listed in python's sys.path list.
