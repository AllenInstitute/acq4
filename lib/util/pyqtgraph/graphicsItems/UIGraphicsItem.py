    """Base class for graphics items with boundaries relative to a GraphicsView or ViewBox.
    The purpose of this class is to allow the creation of GraphicsItems which live inside 
    a scalable view, but whose boundaries will always stay fixed relative to the view's boundaries.
    For example: GridItem, InfiniteLine
    
    The view can be specified on initialization or it can be automatically detected when the item is painted.
    
    NOTE: Only the item's boundingRect is affected; the item is not transformed in any way. Use viewRangeChanged
    to respond to changes in the view.
